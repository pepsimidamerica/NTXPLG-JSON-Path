# NTXPLG-JSON-Path

Form plugin for performing simple JSONPath expressions. Intention is to have two properties: JSON and JSONPath expression. Then display the result as would significantly simplify several workflows we have.

NOTE: No idea if this plugin even works, however. Can't add to NAC without getting the error "Failed to load the plugin definition." even though this follows their example on a Lit plugin near exactly. But whatever.
